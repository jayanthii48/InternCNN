This repo is part of the tutorial [10 Minutes to Building a CNN Image Classifier](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1HgaywLtvIJZ8B9F8oWML772CfxL6UB0p?usp=sharing) hosted on Google Colab

In this tutorial, you will train a simple convolution neural network to perform image classification on dandelions and grass. We will be using TensorFlow/Keras to build our neural network and training/validation dataset.

By the end, you will have the chance to make predictions on your own images!

The zip files contain the training and validation images used in the tutorial.

The latest notebook is also hosted on this repo.
